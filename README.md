## PRUnderground Frontend Assessment

If you've made it here, we're really excited about potentially working with you!
This assessment is to gauge your ability to:

- Familiarity with Git workflows (clones, commits, pull requests, etc.)
- Quickly get up and running in a new codebase
- Turn requirements into code changes
- Create custom plugins to accomplish common frontend tasks.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo
2. Install Composer: https://docs.platform.sh/guides/wordpress/composer.html
3. Create your project

```
composer create-project johnpbloch/wordpress-project [YOUR-NAME]-assessment 1.0.2
```

This will create the project in the `[YOUR-NAME]-assessment` directory. The project uses `public` as the document root, so make sure to take that into account in your host configurations.

Site configuration is in the `.env` file. If you want to define a constant there, prefix the constant name with `WPC_`.

4. get the project running locally.

Here's are the tasks we'd like you to complete:
